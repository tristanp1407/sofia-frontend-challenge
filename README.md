# Todo List Frontend Challenge Submission

Hello Team! ðŸŒŸ

I am thrilled to submit my project for the Todo List Frontend Challenge. Working on this task was both challenging and immensely enjoyable. I've tried to ensure that the application is not only functional but also easy on the eyes and intuitive to use.

## Running the Application ðŸš€

To take a look at what I've built, here's how you can run the app locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

   ```
   yarn
   ```

   This command installs all the necessary dependencies.

3. **Start the Application**: With the dependencies installed, you can now start the app by running:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
4. **Access the App**: Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the application.

I'm excited for you to take it for a spin! I added some hints of Sofia's styling. For example the background gradient used on your site and neutral font color.

## Features included

- Form validation
- Task ordering
- Demo tasks on first load

## Potential Improvements ðŸŒ±

I'm quite happy with the outcome, but there's always room for growth. Here are some areas for potential enhancements:

- **Responsive Design Enhancements**: Grow the description container dynamically with screen width. I opted for media queries for now, but this could be improved.
- **State management**: I used context for state, but arguably a hook would have done the job. First time using React context so wanted to give it a go ðŸ˜„

I eagerly await your feedback on my submission. Thank you for providing me with this opportunity to showcase my abilities.
